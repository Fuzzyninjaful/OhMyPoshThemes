# OhMyPoshThemes

This is a repo to hold any themes that I decide to create for Oh my posh.

## Cyberpunk

This is a theme inspired by the [VS Code 2077 theme](https://github.com/endormi/vscode-2077-theme).

To import, add this line to your powershell prompt
```pwsh
oh-my-posh init powershell --config "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzzyninjaful/OhMyPoshThemes/main/cyberpunk.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
```
